# SOLID and PHP together

This repository is just a set of codes to implement some codes of the article [S.O.L.I.D: The First 5 Principles of Object Oriented Design](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) written by Samuel Oloruntoba, published on Mar 18, 2015.

## The implementation

The implemented codes in this repository are based on [Samuel Oloruntoba's article](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) and has the only objective to apply the S.O.L.I.D principles with the PHP language to study, test and learn the concepts.

Actually, the codes are just parts of a code (not a full or real application), but they run and were tested in PHP 5.6.25.

## About SOLID Principles

S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design principles by Robert C. Martin, popularly known as Uncle Bob.

 - S – Single-responsiblity principle (SRP)
 - O – Open-closed principle (OCP)
 - L – Liskov substitution principle (LSP)
 - I – Interface segregation principle (ISP)
 - D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

For each principle there is a folder in this repository with a sub-folder named Violation/Solution and its codes.
